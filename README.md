Professional software developer that loves to spend some of my free time in solving problems/puzzles.
Recently found out about codewars.com and are currently focusing on solving some of the harder catas
1 and 2 KYU problems. https://www.codewars.com/users/Scheir

In my repos there are solutions to some of the Advent of code, more of these to come when they 
are refactored and ready. There are also some common, very usefull algorithms (djikstra, shunting yard etc, more to come!) that
I learned to apply when solving problems.
Finally there are some useful design patterns, as well as a few implementations of concurrency.

At the moment all code is c++, will be looking into Rust in the future when I feel like a change from c++.

I am also interested in VIM and slowly trying to learn how to effectively use it professionaly. 

Always interested in discussing problems and design patterns related to c++.
