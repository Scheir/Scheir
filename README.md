Software developer by trade who loves to spend some of my free time in solving problems/puzzles.

In my repos there are solutions to some of the Advent of code, more of these to come when they 
are refactored and ready. There are also some common, very usefull algorithms (djikstra, shunting yard etc, more to come!) that
I learned to apply when solving problems.
Finally there are some useful design patterns, as well as a few implementations of concurrency.

My professional language is C++, but I use mostly python for problems/puzzles

Always interested in discussing problems and design patterns related to c++.
